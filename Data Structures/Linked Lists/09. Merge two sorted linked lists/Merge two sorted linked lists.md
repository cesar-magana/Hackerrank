# Merge two sorted linked lists

Youâ€™re given the pointer to the head nodes of two sorted linked lists. The data in both lists will be sorted in ascending order. Change the `next` pointers to obtain a single, merged linked list which also has data in ascending order. Either head pointer given may be null meaning that the corresponding list is empty.

**Input Format**

You have to complete the `SinglyLinkedListNode MergeLists(SinglyLinkedListNode headA, SinglyLinkedListNode headB)` method which takes two arguments - the heads of the two sorted linked lists to merge. You should NOT read any input from stdin/console.

The input is handled by the code in the editor and the format is as follows:

The first line contains an integer t, denoting the number of test cases.
The format for each test case is as follows:

The first line contains an integer n, denoting the length of the first linked list.
The next n lines contain an integer each, denoting the elements of the linked list.
The next line contains an integer m, denoting the length of the second linked list.
The next m lines contain an integer each, denoting the elements of the second linked list.

**Constraints**

- $1 \leq 10$
- $1 \leq n \leq 1000$
- $1 \leq list_i \leq 1000$, where is list_i the i th element in the list.

**Output Format**

Change the `next` pointer of individual nodes so that nodes from both lists are merged into a single list. Then `return` the head of this merged list. Do NOT print anything to stdout/console.

The output is handled by the editor and the format is as follows:

For each test case, print in a new line, the linked list after merging them separated by spaces.

**Sample Input**

```
1
3
1
2
3
2
3
4
```

**Sample Output**

```
1 2 3 3 4 
```

**Explanation**

The first linked list is: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> NULL

The second linked list is: 3 -> 4 -> NULL

Hence, the merged linked list is: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 3 -> 4 -> NULL

# Solution

#### Approach 1

```c++
SinglyLinkedListNode* mergeLists(SinglyLinkedListNode* l1, SinglyLinkedListNode* l2) {
        SinglyLinkedListNode prehead(INT_MIN);
        SinglyLinkedListNode* prev = &prehead;
        
        while ( l1 && l2 ) {
            if ( l1->data <= l2->data ) {
                prev->next = l1;
                l1 = l1->next;
            } else {
                prev->next = l2;
                l2 = l2->next;
            }
            prev = prev->next;
        }
        prev->next = l1 ? l1 : l2;
        return prehead.next;
}
```

#### Approach 2

```c++
SinglyLinkedListNode* mergeLists(SinglyLinkedListNode* l1, SinglyLinkedListNode* l2) {
    if ( !l1 ) return l2;
    if ( !l2 ) return l1;
    
    if ( l1->data < l2->data ) {
        l1->next = mergeLists( l1->next, l2 );
        return l1;
    }
    else {
        l2->next = mergeLists( l2->next, l1 );
        return l2;
    }
}
```

#### Approach 3

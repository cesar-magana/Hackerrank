# Reverse a linked list

Youâ€™re given the pointer to the head node of a linked list. Change the `next` pointers of the nodes so that their order is reversed. The head pointer given may be null meaning that the initial list is empty.

**Input Format**

You have to complete the `SinglyLinkedListNode reverse(SinglyLinkedListNode head)` method which takes one argument - the head of the linked list. You should NOT read any input from stdin/console.

The input is handled by the code in the editor and the format is as follows:

The first line contains an integer t, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case is of the following format:

The first line contains an integer n, denoting the number of elements in the linked list.
The next lines contain an integer each, denoting the elements of the linked list.

**Constraints**

- $1 \leq 10$
- $1 \leq n \leq 1000$
- $1 \leq list_i \leq 1000$, where is list_i the i th element in the list.

**Output Format**

Change the `next` pointers of the nodes that their order is reversed and `return` the head of the reversed linked list. Do NOT print anything to stdout/console.

The output is handled by the code in the editor. The output format is as follows:

For each test case, print in a new line the elements of the linked list after reversing it, separated by spaces.

**Sample Input**

```
1
5
1
2
3
4
5
```

**Sample Output**

```
5 4 3 2 1 
```

**Explanation**

The initial linked list is: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> NULL

The reversed linked list is: 5 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> NULL

# Solution

#### Approach 1

```c++
SinglyLinkedListNode* reverse(SinglyLinkedListNode* head) {
    if ( !head || !head->next ) return head;
    SinglyLinkedListNode* temp = reverse(head->next);
    head->next->next = head;
    head->next = NULL;
    return temp;
}
```

#### Approach 2

```c++
SinglyLinkedListNode* reverse(SinglyLinkedListNode* head) {
    if ( !head || !head->next ) 
        return NULL;
    SinglyLinkedListNode* current = head;
    SinglyLinkedListNode* previous = NULL;
    SinglyLinkedListNode* next = NULL;
    while ( current ) {
        next = current->next;
        current->next = previous;
        previous = current;
        current = next;
    }
    return previous;
}
```

#### Approach 3

```c++
SinglyLinkedListNode* reverse(SinglyLinkedListNode* head) {
    if( !head )
        return head;
    stack<SinglyLinkedListNode*> stk; 
    SinglyLinkedListNode* cursor = head; 
    while( cursor ){
        stk.push( cursor );
        head = cursor; 
        cursor = cursor->next;
    }
    while( !stk.empty() ){
        cursor = stk.top();
        stk.pop();
        if ( stk.empty() )
            cursor->next = NULL; 
        else 
            cursor->next = stk.top();
    }
    return head;
}
```

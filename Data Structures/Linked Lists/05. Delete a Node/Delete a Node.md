# Delete a Node

Youâ€™re given the pointer to the head node of a linked list and the position of a node to delete. Delete the node at the given position and return the head node. A position of 0 indicates head, a position of 1 indicates one node away from the head and so on. The list may become empty after you delete the node.

**Input Format**

You have to complete the `deleteNode(SinglyLinkedListNode* llist, int position)` method which takes two arguments - the head of the linked list and the position of the node to delete. You should NOT read any input from stdin/console. `position` will always be at least 0 and less than the number of the elements in the list.

The first line of input contains an integer *n*, denoting the number of elements in the linked list.
The next *n* lines contain an integer each in a new line, denoting the elements of the linked list in the order.
The last line contains an integer *position* denoting the position of the node that has to be deleted form the linked list.

**Constraints**

- $1 \leq n \leq 1000$
- $1 \leq list_i \1000$ where list_i is the i th element of the linked list.

**Output Format**

Delete the node at the given position and `return` the head of the updated linked list. Do NOT print anything to stdout/console.

The code in the editor will print the updated linked list in a single line separated by spaces.

**Sample Input**

```
8
20
6
2
19
7
4
15
9
3
```

**Sample Output**

```
20 6 2 7 4 15 9
```

**Explanation**

The given linked list is `20->6->2->19->7->4->15->9`. We have to delete the node at position 3, which is 19. After deleting that node, the updated linked list is: `20->6->2->7->4->15->9`

# Solution

#### Approach 1

```c++
SinglyLinkedListNode* deleteNode(SinglyLinkedListNode* head, int position) {
    if ( position == 0 ) {
        return head->next;
    }
    SinglyLinkedListNode* current = head;
    for ( int i = 1; i < position; i++ ) {
        current = current->next;
    }
    current->next = current->next->next;
    return head;
}
```

#### Approach 2

```c++
SinglyLinkedListNode* deleteNode(SinglyLinkedListNode* head, int position) {
    if ( position == 0 ) {
        return head->next;
    }
    else {
        head->next = deleteNode( head->next, position-1 );
    }
    return head;
}
```

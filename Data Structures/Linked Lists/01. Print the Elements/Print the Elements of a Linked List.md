# Print the Elements of a Linked List

This challenge is part of a [MyCodeSchool](http://www.youtube.com/mycodeschool) tutorial track and is accompanied by a [video lesson](http://www.youtube.com/embed/vcQIFT79_50?theme=light).

------

If you're new to *linked lists*, this is a great exercise for learning about them. Given a pointer to the *head* node of a linked list, print its elements in order, one element per line. If the head pointer is null (indicating the list is empty), donâ€™t print anything.

**Input Format**

The first line of input contains , the number of elements in the linked list.
The next lines contain one element each, which are the elements of the linked list.

**Note:** Do not read any input from stdin/console. Complete the printLinkedList function in the editor below.

**Constraints**

- $1 \leq n \leq 1000$
- $1 \leq list_i \leq 1000$, where is the element of the linked list.

**Output Format**

Print the integer data for each element of the linked list to stdout/console (e.g.: using *printf*, *cout*, etc.). There should be one element per line.

**Sample Input**

```
2
16
13
```

**Sample Output**

```
16
13
```

**Explanation**

There are two elements in the linked list. They are represented as 16 -> 13 -> NULL. So, the printLinkedList function should print 16 and 13 each in a new line.

# Solution

```c++
void printLinkedList(SinglyLinkedListNode* head) {
    while ( head ) {
        cout << head->data << endl;
        head = head->next;
    }
}
```
